# Simple nav bar maker for a web page
## Description
Makes an expandable and responsive nav bar (and footer links too) for a web site. Can be used for a few pages or many since the code is created once in the js and passed to each new page.

The app runs from `intro.html` accesses `js/nav.js` and makes use of Knockout (`knockout-3.4.0.js`) to bind functions to the html and make the js simpler.

## Install the project
Clone this repository. Run the project by opening the `.html` file. Find the `.js` file in the `js` directory.
